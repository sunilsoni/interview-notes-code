/**
 * Letter Candles
 * Your friend Alice has a box with N letter candles in it.
 * The cost of the box is determined as follows - And
 * the number of occurrences of each characters in the
 * box and sum up the squares of these numbers.
 * Alice wants to reduce the cost of the box by
 * removing some candles from it However, she is
 * allowed to remove at most Mcand es from the box.
 * Can you help Alice determine the minimum cost of
 * the box?
 * Input
 * The first line of the input contains the integer
 * N, representing the number of letter candles.
 * The second line of the Input contains the integer
 * M representing the number of candles Alice can
 * remove.
 * The third line of the input contains an N-lettered
 * string S which contains lowercase English letters,
 * representing the letter candles in the box.
 * Output
 * Print the minimum possible cost of the box.
 * Example #1
 * input
 * 6
 * 2
 * bacacc
 * Output
 * 6
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Explanation: There are two As, one B, and three Cs in
 * the box. Current cost of the box is 22 + 12 + 32 = 14.
 * The best way to minimize the cost of the box is to
 * remove two C-shaped candles from It The new
 * minimal cost will be 22 + 12 + 12 â€¢ 6. The answer Is 6.
 * Example #2
 * input
 * 15
 * 3
 * xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
 * Output
 * 144
 * Explanation: There are 15 Xs. The current cost of the
 * box is 152 = 225. The only way to minimize the cost
 * is by reducing three X-shaped candles from it. The
 * new minimal cost will be 122 = 144. The answer is
 * 144.
