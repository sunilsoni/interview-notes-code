## **Code Question: Warehouse Dispatch Optimization**

Amazon operates numerous warehouses, each holding a certain amount of inventory (`inventory[i]` units of a product). You and your co-worker are tasked with dispatching items from these warehouses to fulfill customer orders, using the following rules:

### **Dispatch Process:**

1. When dispatching from warehouse `i`, **you** reduce the inventory by `dispatch1` units.
2. After your dispatch, **your co-worker** reduces the inventory by `dispatch2` units.
3. This process repeats for the warehouse until the inventory reaches **zero or becomes negative**.
4. You **earn 1 credit** if the warehouse is emptied **on your turn**.

Your **co-worker** can **skip their turn** up to `skips` times during the process. The challenge is to decide the optimal turns to skip such that **you** maximize the number of **credits** (i.e., the number of warehouses emptied on your turn).

---

## **Function Signature**

```java
public static int getMaximumCredits(List<Integer> inventory, int dispatch1, int dispatch2, int skips)
```

### **Parameters**

* `inventory`: List of integers, inventory at each warehouse
* `dispatch1`: Integer, your dispatch units per turn
* `dispatch2`: Integer, your co-worker's dispatch units per turn
* `skips`: Integer, maximum number of turns your co-worker can skip

### **Return**

* `int`: The **maximum number of credits** both you and your co-worker can collectively earn (i.e., number of warehouses emptied **on your turn**)

---

## **Constraints**

* $1 \leq n \leq 10^5$
* $1 \leq \text{inventory}[i], \text{dispatch1}, \text{dispatch2}, \text{skips} \leq 10^9$

---

## **Example 1**

### **Input**

```plaintext
inventory = [10, 6, 12, 8, 15, 1]
dispatch1 = 2
dispatch2 = 3
skips = 3
```

### **Output**

```plaintext
5
```

### **Explanation**

Optimally skip turns to maximize the warehouses you can empty:

* Skip at warehouse 1 and 4
* Resulting in 5 warehouses emptied on your turn

---

## **Example 2**

### **Input**

```plaintext
inventory = [3, 7, 17, 21, 12, 19]
dispatch1 = 4
dispatch2 = 3
skips = 2
```

### **Output**

```plaintext
4
```

---

## **Example 3**

### **Input**

```plaintext
inventory = [1, 101]
dispatch1 = 1
dispatch2 = 100
skips = 2
```

### **Output**

```plaintext
1
```

/**
 * Warehouse Dispatch Optimization
 * 
 * You and a co-worker take turns dispatching items from warehouses.
 * You remove 'dispatch1' units, then co-worker removes 'dispatch2'.
 * Co-worker can skip up to 'skips' turns (shared budget across all warehouses).
 * You earn a credit when you empty a warehouse on your turn.
 * 
 * This implementation computes the minimum skips needed per warehouse
 * to ensure you end on your turn, then uses a greedy strategy to
 * maximize credits within the skip budget.
