Problem Description
Digital graphics tools often make available a “bucket fill” tool that will recolor only adjacent cells. In this problem, you have a modified bucket tool that recolors all adjacent cells (connected horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally) that share the same color.
Given a picture represented as a 2-dimensional array of letters (each letter is a “color”), find the minimum number of bucket-fill strokes required to repaint the entire picture.
In one fill (stroke), you pick a cell, and every cell in that cell’s maximal 4-connected region of the same letter is recolored at once.


Different connected regions of the same letter each require a separate stroke.


You must count how many total connected components exist (across all letters) and return that as the answer.
