WORKING 100%


### **Code Question 1**
A product name at Amazon is represented as a string \( s \) of length \( n \) that consists of lowercase English letters.
A team at Amazon is working on a productâ€™s search algorithm.

They want to know the length of the longest substring in a product name with its first character lexicographically smaller than its last.
A valid substring must be longer than 1 character. If no such substring exists, return 0.

**Note:**
A character \( a \) is lexicographically smaller than character \( b \) if \( a \) appears in the English alphabet sequence before \( b \).

#### **Example**
The string \( s = "ecbdca" \).
There are two longest valid substrings:
- `"cbd"`, \( s[1:3] \) shown, and
- `"bdc"`, \( s[2:4] \).

Both start with a smaller character than they end with and have three characters.

**Return their length: 3.**
Note that `"cbdc"` is not valid since the starting character is not smaller than the last.

---

### **Function Description**
Complete the function **`findMaxChainLength`** in the editor below.

#### **Function Signature**
```java
public static int findMaxChainLength(String s)
```

#### **Parameters**
- `string s`: The product name.

#### **Returns**
- `int`: The length of the longest valid substring.

#### **Constraints**
- \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
- \( s \) consists of lowercase English letters only.

---

### **Input Format For Custom Testing**
The only line contains a string \( s \).

---

### **Sample Cases**

#### **Sample Case 0**
##### **Input**
```
abcd
```
##### **Output**
```
4
```
##### **Explanation**
The entire string is a valid substring.
Here, `a` is lexicographically smaller than `d`, so it is a valid substring.

---

#### **Sample Case 1**
##### **Input**
```
fghbbadcba
```
##### **Output**
```
5
```
##### **Explanation**
The longest valid substring is `"bbadc"`.
Here, `b` is lexicographically smaller than `c`, so it is a valid substring.
