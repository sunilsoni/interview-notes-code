### **Code Question 2**
In Amazonâ€™s massive warehouse inventory, there are \( n \) different types of products.
You are given an array **products** of size \( n \), where `products[i]` represents the number of items of product type \( i \) (where \( i \) ranges from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \)).
These products need to be packed into batches for shipping.

The batch packing must adhere to the following conditions:
1. No two items in the same batch can be of the same product type, meaning all items in a batch must be of distinct types.
2. The number of items packed in the current batch must be strictly greater than the number packed in the previous batch.

Additionally, note that:
- Each item can be packed only once.
- It is not required to pack every item.

#### **Determine the maximum number of batches that can be prepared for shipment.**

**Note:**
The product types are numbered from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \).
Thus, the number of items of product type \( i \) \((0 \leq i \leq n-1)\) is given by `products[i]`.

---

### **Example**
#### **Input**
```
n = 5
products = [2, 3, 1, 4, 2]
```

#### **Optimal way to prepare the batches:**
1. The first batch contains **1** item of product type **4**. Remaining items: `[2, 3, 1, 4, 1]`
2. The second batch contains **2** items of product types: **0** and **1**. Remaining items: `[1, 2, 1, 4, 1]`
3. The third batch contains **3** items of product types: **0, 1, and 3**. Remaining items: `[0, 1, 1, 3, 1]`
4. The fourth batch contains **4** items of product types: **1, 2, 3, and 4**. Remaining items: `[0, 0, 0, 2, 0]`

Even though 2 items remain, a batch requires 5 items of different product types.
Therefore, **only 4 batches** can be prepared, which is the maximum possible.

#### **Output**
```
4
```

---

### **Function Description**
Complete the function **maximizeGroups** in the editor below.

#### **Function Signature**
```java
public static int maximizeGroups(List<Integer> products)
```

#### **Parameters**
- `List<Integer> products`: The number of items of each product type.

#### **Returns**
- `int`: The maximum number of batches that can be prepared for shipment.

---

### **Constraints**
- \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
- \( 0 \leq products[i] \leq 10^9 \)

---

### **Input Format For Custom Testing**
- The first line contains an integer, \( n \), denoting the size of the array **products**.
- Each of the next \( n \) lines contains an integer describing **products[i]**.

---

### **Sample Cases**

#### **Sample Case 0**
##### **Input**
```
3
1
2
7
```
##### **Output**
```
3
```
##### **Explanation**
The optimal way to prepare the batches is:
1. First batch: **1** item of product type **2**, remaining: `[1, 2, 6]`
2. Second batch: **2** items of product types **1 and 2**, remaining: `[1, 1, 5]`
3. Third batch: **3** items of product types **0, 1, and 2**, remaining: `[0, 0, 4]`

Four items are required for the next batch, but only three remain, all of the same type.
Thus, the answer is **3**.

---

#### **Sample Case 1**
##### **Input**
```
4
1
2
8
9
```
##### **Output**
```
4
```
##### **Explanation**
The optimal way to prepare the batches is:
1. First batch: **1** item of product type **3**, remaining: `[1, 2, 8]`
2. Second batch: **2** items of product types **2 and 3**, remaining: `[1, 2, 7]`
3. Third batch: **3** items of product types **1, 2, and 3**, remaining: `[1, 1, 6]`
4. Fourth batch: **4** items of product types **0, 1, 2, and 3**, remaining: `[0, 0, 5]`

The next batch requires 5 distinct types, but only 2 distinct types are left.
Thus, the answer is **4**.
