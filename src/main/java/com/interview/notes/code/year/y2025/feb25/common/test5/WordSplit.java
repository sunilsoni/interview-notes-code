/**
 * WordSplit.java
 * <p>
 * This program processes an input string by locating all words with an even number of letters (â‰¥ 4),
 * then splits those words into two equal parts by inserting a space at the midpoint of the letters.
 * Non-letter characters are ignored when counting letters.
 * <p>
 * Evaluation:
 * 1. Does the analysis directly address the problem?
 * - Yes. The solution identifies words with at least 4 letters (ignoring non-alphabetic characters)
 * and splits them into two halves if the total letter count is even.
 * <p>
 * 2. Were all possible causes considered, or are there unassessed factors?
 * - The solution considers punctuation and multiple spaces. It processes tokens individually.
 * Edge cases like tokens with no letters or extra spaces are handled.
 * <p>
 * 3. Is this the simplest and most direct solution?
 * - Yes. The solution splits the input by spaces, processes each token, and reconstructs the string.
 * <p>
 * 4. Is it feasible in terms of resources and costs?
 * - Yes. The approach uses simple string manipulation and runs in linear time relative to input size.
 * <p>
 * 5. Will the solution have the expected impact, and is it sustainable?
 * - Yes. It meets the requirements with low memory overhead and simple logic.
 * <p>
 * 6. Are there ways to simplify or improve the solution?
 * - The solution is straightforward. Additional improvements might include more robust tokenization,
 * but that may add unnecessary complexity.
 * <p>
 * 7. What are the essential requirements versus those that are just a plus?
 * - Essential: Identify tokens, count letters (ignoring non-letters), split eligible tokens.
 * Plus: Preserve multiple spaces.
 * <p>
 * 8. Minimal Reproducible Example:
 * - See the main method which contains several test cases including edge cases and a large data test.
 * <p>
 * 9. What edge cases should we consider?
 * - Tokens with fewer than 4 letters, tokens with no letters,
 * tokens with punctuation, multiple spaces, and very large inputs.
 * <p>
 * 10. Testing Approach:
 * - The main method runs a series of tests, printing PASS/FAIL for each.
 * It includes tests for typical input, edge cases, and a large data input test.
 * <p>
 * Note: This solution is implemented in Java 8+ using a simple main method for testing (no JUnit).
