**Problem Statement:**

There is a company which has a CEO and a hierarchy of employees.
All employees have:

* A unique ID
* A name (not unique)
* A pointer to their manager
* A set of direct reports

You are required to implement the method `whoIsOurBoss()` that finds the **closest common manager** for two given employees.
That is, the **lowest common ancestor (LCA)** in the organizational tree â€” the manager **farthest from the CEO** that both employees report up to.

**Class Definition:**

```java
class Employee {
    long id;                    // unique ID
    String name;                // name (not unique)
    Employee manager;           // null for CEO
    Set<Employee> reports;      // empty set for a non-manager
}
```
