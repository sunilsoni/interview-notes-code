Here is the **complete combined and structured version** of your problem statement based on all uploaded screenshots:

---

### üì¶ Package Distribution Network

You are managing a network of distribution centers. Each center has a specific capacity for how many packages it can process before needing a reset.

---

### üßæ Input

* `int[] centerCapacities`:
  An array of integers representing the max number of packages each center can handle in one rotation.

  * Constraints: `1 ‚â§ centerCapacities.length ‚â§ 100`
  * Each capacity: `1 ‚â§ centerCapacities[i] ‚â§ 5`

* `String[] dailyLog`:
  An array of logs representing operations that can be either:

  * `"PACKAGE"` ‚Äî one new package arrives
  * `"CLOSURE <j>"` ‚Äî the j-th center is closed for renovation
  * Constraints: `1 ‚â§ dailyLog.length ‚â§ 1000`

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Processing Rules

* Packages are processed in order, starting from center `0` and moving forward sequentially.
* Each center can process up to its given capacity. After one full rotation (back to center 0), all capacities reset to full **but closed centers remain closed**.
* Closed centers are skipped entirely during processing.
* If a log is `"CLOSURE j"`, then the j-th center is marked closed and is never reopened.

---

### ‚úÖ Function Signature

```java
int solution(int[] centerCapacities, String[] dailyLog)
```

---

### üéØ Output

* Return the **index** of the center that processed the **maximum number of packages**.
* If there's a tie, return the **highest index** among those tied centers.

---

### üí° Notes

* At least one center is always operational.
* Skipped centers (closed ones) are never reopened.
* You can assume that the input constraints ensure feasibility.

---

### üß™ Example

```java
centerCapacities = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]

dailyLog = [
    "PACKAGE",
    "PACKAGE",
    "CLOSURE 2",
    "PACKAGE",
    "CLOSURE 3",
    "PACKAGE",
    "PACKAGE"
]
```

**Output:** `1`

---

### üîç Step-by-Step Explanation:

```
Step 1: PACKAGE  ‚Üí center 0 ‚Üí capacity becomes [0, 2, 1, 2, 1]
Step 2: PACKAGE  ‚Üí center 1 ‚Üí capacity becomes [0, 1, 1, 2, 1]
Step 3: CLOSURE 2 ‚Üí center 2 closed
Step 4: PACKAGE  ‚Üí center 1 ‚Üí capacity becomes [0, 0, 1, 2, 1]
Step 5: CLOSURE 3 ‚Üí center 3 closed
Step 6: PACKAGE  ‚Üí center 4 ‚Üí capacity becomes [0, 0, 1, 2, 0]
Step 7: PACKAGE  ‚Üí center 0 ‚Üí all center capacities reset except closed ‚Üí new capacities [1, 2, 1 (closed), 2 (closed), 1]
           ‚Üí center 0 ‚Üí capacity becomes [0, 2, X, X, 1]
```

**Package processed count per center:**
`[2, 2, 0, 0, 1]` ‚Üí max = 2 ‚Üí **highest index = 1**
