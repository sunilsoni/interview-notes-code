/**
 * Account Comparisons in java
 * Given an interface named "OnlineAccounf that models the account of popular online video streaming platforms,
 * perform the operations listed below. The interface "OnlineAccounf consists of the basePrice, regularMoviePrice, and
 * exclusiveMoviePrice.
 * In order to complete this challenge, you need to implement an incomplete class named "Account' which implements
 * the "OnlineAccounf interface as well as the "Comparable<Account>" interface.
 * Class Account has two attributes to keep track of the number of movies watched:
 * 1. Integer noOfRegularMovies
 * 2. Integer noOfExclusiveMovies
 * 3. String ownerName
 * Methods to complete for class Account:
 * 1. Add a parameterized constructor t hat initializes the attributes ownerName, numberOfRegularMovies,
 * and numberOfExclusiveMovies.
 * 2. Int monthlyCostQ => This method returns the monthly cost for the account. [Monthly Cost = base price
 * + noOfRegularMovies*regularMoviePrice + noOfExclusiveMovies*exclusiveMoviePrice]
 * 3. Override the compareTo method of the Comparable interface such that two accounts can be compared based on their
 * monthly cost.
 * 4. String toStringf) which returns => "Owner is [ownerName] and monthly cost is [monthlyCost] USD."
