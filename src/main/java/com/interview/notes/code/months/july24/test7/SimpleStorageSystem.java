/*
The simple storage system should support adding files as well as deleting files.
Operations:
ADD_FILE <file_name>
Should add a new file with name file_name to the storage.
If a file with the same name file_name already exists, the current operation fails.
Returns "true" if the file was added successfully, or "false" otherwise.
DELETE_FILE <file_name>
Should delete the file with the file_name.
Returns "true" if the file was deleted successfully.
Returns "false" if the file doesn't exist.
