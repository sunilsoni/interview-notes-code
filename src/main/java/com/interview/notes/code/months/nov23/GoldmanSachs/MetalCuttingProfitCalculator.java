/**
 * Cutting Metal Surplus
 * The owner of a construction company has a surplus of rods of arbitrary lengths. A local contractor offers to buy any
 * of the surplus, as long as all the rods have the same exact integer length, referred to as saleLength. The number of
 * sellable rods can be increased by cutting each rod zero or more times, but each cut has a cost denoted by
 * costPerCut. After all cuts have been made, ary leftover rods having a length other than saleLength must be
 * discarded for no profit. The ownerâ€™s total profit for the sale is calculated as:
 * tota/Profit = totalUniformRods * saleLength * salePrice - totalCuts * costPerCut
 * where totalUniformRods is the number of sellable rods, salePrice is the per unit length price that the contractor
 * agrees to pay, and totalCuts is the total number of times the rods needed to be cut.
 * Example
 * lengths = [30, 59, 110]
 * costPerCut = 1
 * salePrice = 10 per unit lergth
 * The following are tests based on lengths that are factors of 30, the length of the shortest bar. Factors of other
 * lengths might also be tested, but this demonstrates the methodology.
