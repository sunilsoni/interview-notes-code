/**
 * A team of analysts at Amazon needs to analyze the stock prices of Amazon over a period of several months. A group of consecutively chosen months is said to be maximum profitable if the price in its first or last month is the maximum for the group. More formally, a group of consecutive months [l, r] (1 â‰¤ l < r < n) is said to be maximum profitable if either:
 * <p>
 * stockPrice[l] = max(stockPrice[l], stockPrice[l + 1], ..., stockPrice[r])
 * or, stockPrice[r] = max(stockPrice[l], stockPrice[l + 1], ..., stockPrice[r])
 * Given prices over n consecutive months, find the number of maximum profitable groups which can be formed. Note that the months chosen must be consecutive, i.e., you must choose a subarray of the given array.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * Consider there are n = 3 months of data, stockPrice = [2, 3, 2]. All possible groups are shown in the leftmost column

/**
 * Complexity Analysis
 * Time Complexity: O(n^3) - The nested loops contribute to a cubic time complexity since for each subarray, we find the maximum element.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - We only use a fixed number of variables, so the space complexity is constant.
