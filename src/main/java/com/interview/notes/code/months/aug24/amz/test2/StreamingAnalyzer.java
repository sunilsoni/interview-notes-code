/**
 * 1. Code Question 1
 * Data analysts at Amazon are studying the trends in movies and shows popular on Prime Video in order to enhance the user experience.
 * They have identified the best critic-rated and the best audience-rated web series, represented by integer IDs series 1, and series2. They also define the watch score of a contiguous period of some days as the number of distinct series watched by a viewer during that period.
 * Given an array watch_history, of size n, that represents the web series watched by a viewer over a period of n days, and two integers, series1 and series2, report the minimum watch score of a contiguous period of days in which both series 1 and series2 have been viewed at least once. If series 1 and series2 are the same value, one occurrence during the period is sufficient.
 * Example
 * n = 5
 * series 1 = 1
 * series2 = 2
 * watch_history = [1, 3, 2, 1, 4]
 * The contiguous periods of days in which series and series2 have been viewed at least once are:-
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Period of days
 * (Subarray of watch _history)
 * Watch Score
 * (Distinct series watched)
 * [1, 3, 2]
 * 3
 * [3, 2, 1]
 * 3
 * [2, 1]
 * 2
 * [1, 3, 2, 1]
 * 3
 * [1, 3, 2, 1, 4]
 * 4
 * Return the minimum watch score, 2.
 * Function Description
 * Complete the function getMinScore in the editor below.
 * getMinScore has the following parameters:
 * int watch_historyn]: the watch history of a viewer over n days int series 1: ID of the best critic-rated web series int series2: ID of the best audience-rated web series
 * Returns
 * least once
 * int: the minimum watch score of a contiguous period of days in which series1 and series2 have been viewed at
 * Constraints
 * ・Isnsios
 * • 1 s watch_historyfi] $ 10°, where Osi<n
 * • 1 ≤ series1, series2 ≤ 109 , series and series2 are not necessarily distinct.
 * • There will be at least one occurrence of both series 1 and series2 in watch_history.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input Format For Custom Testing
 * The first line contains an integer, n, the number of elements in watch_history Each of the next n contains an integer, watch_history.
 * The next line contains an integer, series 1.
 * The next line contains an integer, series2.

 * watch_history[] size n = 6
 * watch_history = [1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2]

 * series2 = 5
 * Explanation
 * Given n = 6, watch
 * _history = [1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2], series1= 1, and series2= 5.
 * There is only one period in which both series 1 and series? have been watched, i.e., the subarray [1, 2, 2, 2, 5]. The watch score of this period is 3, which is the minimum possible.

 * Explanation
 * Given, n = 5, watch_history = [1, 2, 3, 5, 1] series 1= 5, and series2= 5.
 * Among all the periods of days in which both series 1 and series2, i.e. series with ID = 5 have been watched, the
 * subarray with the least watch score is [5]. Its watch score is 1.
